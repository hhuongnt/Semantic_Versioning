# Semantic_Versioning
Software versioning is the process of assigning unique version numbers to unique states of computer software. These numbers are generally assigned in increasing order and correspond to new developments in the software.  Modern computer software is often tracked using two different software versioning schemesâ€”internal version number that may be incremented many times in a single day, such as a revision control number, and a released version that typically changes far less often, such as semantic versioning or a project code name.  Semantic versioning is a simple set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented. These rules are based on but not necessarily limited to pre-existing widespread common practices in use in both closed and open-source software.  Version numbers are denoted using a standard tuple of integers: major.minor.patch.
